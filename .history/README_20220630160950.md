1. ### How can you pass a variable by reference
   To be able to pass a variable by reference, we use an ampersand in front of it, as follows:
```
$var1 = &$var2
```

2. ### What does $GLOBALS mean
    $GLOBALS is associative array including references to all variables which are currently defined in the global scope of the script.

3. ### What is the difference between == and === ?
   * The operator == casts between two different types if they are different
   * The === operator performs a 'typesafe comparison'
     
   That means that it will only return true if both operands have the same type and the same value.
   ```
   1 === 1: true
   1 == 1: true
   1 === "1": false // 1 is an integer, "1" is a string
   1 == "1": true // "1" gets casted to an integer, which is 1
   "foo" === "foo": true // both operands are strings and have the same value
   ```

4. ### What is the use of ini_set()?
   PHP allows the user to modify some of its settings mentioned in php.ini using ini_set(). This function requires two string arguments. First one is the name of the setting to be modified and the second one is the new value to be assigned to it.

   Given line of code will enable the display_error setting for the script if it’s disabled.

   ```
   ini_set('display_errors', '1');
   ```

   We need to put the above statement, at the top of the script so that, the setting remains enabled till the end. Also, the values set via ini_set() are applicable, only to the current script. Thereafter, PHP will start using the original values from php.ini.

5. ### Is multiple inheritance supported in PHP?
    PHP supports only single inheritance; it means that a class can be extended from only one single class using the keyword 'extended'.

6. ### Differentiate between echo and print()
   echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

    The differences are:
    * echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
    * echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
    * echo is faster than print.

7. ### Explain how we handle exceptions in PHP

   When an exception is thrown, code following the statement will not be executed, and PHP will attempt to find the first matching catch block. If an exception is not caught, a PHP Fatal Error will be issued with an "Uncaught Exception". An exception can be thrown, and caught within PHP.

   To handle exceptions, code may be surrounded in a ```try``` block. Each try must have at least one corresponding ```catch block```. Multiple catch blocks can be used to catch different classes of exceptions. Exceptions can be thrown (or re-thrown) within a catch block.

   Consider

   ```
      try {
         print "this is our try block n";
         throw new Exception();
      } catch (Exception $e) {
         print "something went wrong, caught yah! n";
      } finally {
         print "this part is always executed n";
      }
   ```

8. ### What is PDO in PHP?
   PDO stands for PHP Data Object.

   It is a set of PHP extensions that provide a core PDO class and database, specific drivers. It provides a vendor-neutral, lightweight, data-access abstraction layer. Thus, no matter what database we use, the function to issue queries and fetch data will be same. It focuses on data access abstraction rather than database abstraction.

9. ### What does the 'var' keyword mean in PHP
   The var keyword creates a property in a class. Since PHP 5, it is equivalent to the public keyword.
   <p class="note"> <strong>Note </strong>: The var keyword is only used for compatibility reasons. Since PHP 5, the keywords private, protected and public should be used instead.</p>

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

10. ### Explain what the different PHP errors are

      * A **notice** is a non-critical error saying something went wrong in execution, something minor like an undefined variable.
      * A **warning**  is given when a more critical error like if an include() command went to retrieve a non-existent file. In both this and the error above, the script would continue.
      * A **fatal error**  would terminate the code. Failure to satisfy a require() would generate this type of error, for example.
      *

11. ### Is there a difference between isset and !empty

      ### Isset function
      ISSET checks the variable to see if it has been set. In other words, it checks to see if the variable is any value except NULL or not assigned a value. ISSET returns TRUE if the variable exists and has a value other than NULL. That means variables assigned a "", 0, "0", or FALSE are set, and therefore are TRUE for ISSET.

      **empty function**

      EMPTY checks to see if a variable is empty. Empty is interpreted as: "" (an empty string), 0 (integer), 0.0 (float)`, "0" (string), NULL, FALSE, array() (an empty array), and "$var;" (a variable declared, but without a value in a class.
      
      |Expression|gettype()|empty()|is_null()|isset()|bool : if($x)|
      |----------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
      |$x = "";|string|true|false|true|false|
      |$x = null;|NULL|true|true|false|false|
      |var $x;|NULL|true|true|false|false|
      |$x is undefined|NULL|true|true|false|false|
      |$x = [];|array|true|false|true|false|
      |$x = ['a', 'b'];|array|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = false;|bool|true|false|true|false|
      |$x = true;|bool|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = 1;|int|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = 42;|int|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = 0;|int|true|false|true|false|
      |$x = -1;|int|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = "1";|string|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = "0";|string|true|false|true|false|
      |$x = "-1";|string|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = "php";|string|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = "true";|string|false|false|true|true|
      |$x = "false";| string| false	|false|	true	|true|

13. ### What is stdClass in PHP?
      **stdClass** is just a generic **'empty'** class that's used when casting other types to objects. **stdClass** is not the base class for objects in PHP. This can be demonstrated fairly

      ```
      class Foo{}
      $foo = new Foo();
      echo ($foo instanceof stdClass)?'Y':'N'; // outputs 'N'
      ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14. ### What's the difference between isset() and array_key_exists()?

* array_key_exists will tell you if a key exists in an array and complains when $a does not exist.
* isset will only return true if the key/variable exists and is not null. isset doesn't complain when $a does not exist.

```
$a = array('key1' => 'Foo Bar', 'key2' => null);

isset($a['key1']);             // true
array_key_exists('key1', $a);  // true

isset($a['key2']);             // false
array_key_exists('key2', $a);  // true
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is the difference between var_dump() and print_r()?

* The var_dump function displays structured information about variables/expressions including its type and value. Arrays are explored recursively with values indented to show structure. It also shows which array values and object properties are references.

* The print_r() displays information about a variable in a way that's readable by humans. array values will be presented in a format that shows keys and elements. Similar notation is used for objects.

   ```
   $obj = (object) array('qualitypoint', 'technologies', 'India');
   ```
   var_dump($obj)will display below output in the screen:

   ```
   object(stdClass)#1 (3) {
   [0]=> string(12) "qualitypoint"
   [1]=> string(12) "technologies"
   [2]=> string(5) "India"
   }
   ```
   And, print_r($obj) will display below output in the screen.

   ```
   stdClass Object ( 
   [0] => qualitypoint
   [1] => technologies
   [2] => India
   )
   ```

16. ### Give me some real life examples when you had to use __destruct in your classes

   We know that __destruct is called when the object is destroyed. Logically, what happens if the object is destroyed? Well, it means it's no longer available. So if it has resources open, it makes sense to close those resources as it's being destroyed or cleaning up after itself. Also because PHP will close resources on termination for you doesn't mean that it's bad to explicitly close them when you no longer need them (or good to not close them).

   Some real examples are:

* Closing custom database connector/wrapper connection
* Deletion of temporary folders
* Cleaning up caching
* Spooling the queue of logging messages to db/file

17. ### What is a class?

   A class is a template for an object, a user-defined datatype that contains variables, properties, and methods.

   Class represents all properties and behaviors of object.

   ```
   class Person{
    public $name;
    public $age;
    function __construct($name, $age){
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
    function getUserDetails(){
        return "Hi, My Name is ".$this->name." and I'm ". $this->age ." old 
   ";
      }
   }
   //To create php object we have to use a new operator. 

   $obj = new Person("Ajay", 23);
   echo $obj->getUserDetails();

   //Output:
   Hi, My Name is Ajay and I'm 23 old 
   ```

18. ### What is an object?

   Objects are created from Classes, is an instance of a class that is created dynamically.

   Object in programming is similar to real word object. Every programming object has some properties and behaviors.

   You can create object of class with the help of new keyword

   ```
      //Create an object of MyClas 
   $obj = new MyClass();
   OR
   $obj = new MyClass;
   ```
19. ### What is Constructor and Destructor?

   **Constructor:**

   Constructor is a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is any object created from a class.

   ```
   class myClass{
      function __construct(){
         // Define logic in constructor
      }
   }
   ```

 **Destructor:**

   Destructor is a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever any object is deleted or goes out of scope.

   ```
   class myClass{
      function __construct(){
      // Define logic in constructor
      }
      function __destruct(){
      // this is destructor 
      }
   }
   ```
20. ### What is Member Variable and Member function?

   **Member Variable** − These are the variables defined inside a class. This data will be invisible to the outside of the class and can be accessed via member functions. These variables are called attribute of the object once an object is created.

   **Member function** − These are the function defined inside a class and are used to access object data.

   ```
   <?php
   class Books {
      /* Member variables */
      public $price;
      public $title;
      
      /* Member functions */
      function setPrice($par){
         $this->price = $par;
      }
      
      function getPrice(){
         echo $this->price ."<br/>";
      }
      
      function setTitle($par){
         $this->title = $par;
      }
      
      function getTitle(){
         echo $this->title ." <br/>";
      }
   }
   ```
21. ### What is different types of Visibility? OR What are access modifiers?

   Each method and property has its visibility. There are three types of visibility in PHP.

   Types of visibility:

1. **public:** Public method or variable can be accessible from anywhere, Means a public method or variable of a class can be called outside of the class or in a subclass.
1. **protected:** A protected method or variable can only be called in that class & it's subclass.
1. **private:** A private method or variable of a class can only be called inside that class only in which it is declared.

NOTE: By default, in PHP, a class member is public unless declared private or protected.

22. ### What is Encapsulation?

   ```Wrapping up member variables and methods together into a single unit (i.e. Class) is called Encapsulation.```

1. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.
1. Visibility is the mechanism for encapsulation.

```
class Person {
	private $name;

	public function setName($name) {
		$this->name = $name;
	}

	public function getName($name) {
		return $this->name;
	}
}

$personObj = new Person();
$personObj->setName('Full Stack Tutorials');
$personObj->getName();
```
23. ### What is Abstraction?

   ```Abstraction is a concept in which implementation details are hidden.```

   **Abstract Class:**

   ```Abstract class are class which contains atleast one or more abstract method.```

   **Abstract Method:**

   ```Abstract method is a method which is declared, but not defined.```

1. PHP 5 introduces abstract classes and methods.
1. Classes defined as abstract may not be instantiated
1. Classes that contains at least one abstract method must also be abstract.
1. Methods defined as abstract simply declare the method's signature - they cannot define the implementation. Abstract methods cannot be defined as private.
1. Classes which are inheriting it's parent class must provides implementations for the abstract methods.

24. ### PHP Namespaces

   Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:

1. They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
2. They allow the same name to be used for more than one class

## Best Practices for Securing API endpoints
<details>
  <summary>HTTPS always</summary>  
   If your API endpoints allow API consumers to talk over http or other non-secure protocols, you’re putting them at a big risk. Passwords, secret keys, and credit card information can easily get stolen as any man-in-the-middle attack, or packet sniffer tool can read them as plain text.

   So, always make https the only option available. No matter how trivial an endpoint might seem, connecting over http shouldn’t even be an option
</details>
<details>
  <summary>One-way password hashing</summary> 
  Passwords should never be stored as plain text, as in the event that a security breach occurs, all the user accounts will be compromised. At the same time, symmetric encryption should be strictly avoided, as any attacker ingenious and persistent enough will be able to break them.

   The only suggested option is asymmetric (or “one-way”) encryption algorithms for storing passwords. That way, neither an attacker nor any developer or sysadmin within the company will get to read customer passwords.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Strong authentication</summary> 
 Now, almost every API has a form of authentication, but in my opinion, the OAuth2 system works the best. As opposed to other authentication methods, it divides your account into resources and allows only limited access to the auth token bearer.

At the same time, another very good practice to set tokens to expire every, say, 24 hours, so that they need to be refreshed. This way, even if your token gets leaked, there’s a chance that the 24-hour deadline will reduce the impact of the breach.
</details>
